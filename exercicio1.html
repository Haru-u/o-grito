                <article>
                    &nbsp; The Scream (Norwegian: Skrik) is the popular name given to multiple versions of a composition by Norwegian Expressionist
                    artist Edvard Munch between 1893 and 1910. The German title Munch gave these works is Der Schrei der
                    Natur (The Scream of Nature). The works show a figure with an agonized expression against a landscape
                    with a tumultuous orange sky. Arthur Lubow has described The Scream as "an icon of modern art, a Mona
                    Lisa for our time." Edvard Munch created four versions in paint and pastels. The National Gallery in
                    Oslo, Norway, holds one of two painted versions (1893, shown at right). The Munch Museum holds the other
                    painted version (1910, see gallery, below) and also a pastel version from 1893. These three versions
                    have seldom traveled, though the 1893 pastel was exhibited at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam in
                    2015. The second pastel version from 1895 was sold for $119,922,600 at Sotheby's Impressionist and
                    Modern Art auction on 2 May 2012 to financier Leon Black, the fourth highest nominal price paid
                    for a painting at auction and was displayed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York from October 2012
                    to April 2013.
